## How Saving Works

PUM Companion uses both **auto-save** and **manual save** to protect your progress:

- **Auto-Save:**
	- Your game is saved automatically as you make changes (e.g., editing story elements, adding characters, or progressing the plot).
	- You don’t need to worry about losing progress if you forget to save.

- **Manual Save:**
	- A **Save** button is available in the Main Menu and sometimes in other screens.
	- Tap it to immediately save your current progress.
	- Manual save is useful before making big changes or exiting the app.

- **Where Are Saves Stored?**
	- Saved games are stored locally on your device in the app’s save folder.
	- Each game is saved as a separate file, using the name you gave your adventure.
	- If you rename your game, the save file is updated automatically.

- **Game List:**
	- All saved games appear in the Main Menu, with the most recently played at the top.
	- Each entry shows the game’s name and cover image (if set).

## Loading Games

- **From the Main Menu:**
	- Tap any saved game to load it instantly.
	- The app restores your story, world, characters, and progress exactly as you left them.

- **Recently Played:**
	- The most recently played games are shown first for quick access.

- **Game Versions:**
	- Only one version of each game is kept by default. For backups or older versions, use the export feature.

## Exporting & Importing Games

Exporting and importing lets you back up your games, move them between devices, or share them with others.

- **Exporting:**
	- Use the **Export** option in the Main Menu or game settings.
	- Choose a location to save the exported file (e.g., your device, cloud storage, or external drive).
	- Exported files can be re-imported later or shared with friends.

- **Importing:**
	- Use the **Import** option to add a game from a file or from Google Drive.
	- Imported games appear in your Main Menu alongside your other saves.

- **Google Drive Integration:**
	- You can import and export directly to Google Drive for easy cloud backup and transfer.
	- For full details, see the [Cloud Backup](pum-cloud-backup.md) documentation.

## How Cloud Backup Interacts with Saving

- **Cloud Sync:**
	- If you enable Google Drive integration, your saves can be automatically or manually backed up to the cloud.
	- This keeps your adventures safe even if you lose your device.
	- You can restore games from the cloud on any device where PUM Companion is installed.

- **Manual Cloud Upload/Download:**
	- You can manually upload a save to Google Drive or download a backup at any time.
	- Use this to transfer games between devices or recover from a backup.

- **Auto-Save to Cloud:**
	- When enabled, every time your game is saved locally, it is also synced to Google Drive.

- **For setup and troubleshooting, see:**
	- [Cloud Backup](pum-cloud-backup.md)

- Export backups regularly to another location (cloud or external drive).
- Use clear, descriptive names for your games to avoid confusion.
- Enable cloud backup for extra safety and easy device transfers.
- Periodically check that your cloud backups are up to date.
