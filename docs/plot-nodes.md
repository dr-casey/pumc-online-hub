# Plot Nodes

Plot Nodes are the essential elements that make up your story’s universe. They are the people, places, problems, discoveries, and mysteries that drive your narrative forward.

## What are Plot Nodes?
Plot Nodes are flexible, freeform entries you create to represent:

- **Game or World Elements:** Key features that define your setting (e.g., ancient ruins, oppressive government, magical storms).
- **Potential Obstacles:** Dangers, challenges, or enemies (e.g., rival factions, natural disasters, inner fears).
- **Useful Findings:** Discoveries that help the protagonists (e.g., secret maps, powerful artifacts, hidden allies).
- **Pending Questions:** Mysteries or unresolved issues (e.g., Who betrayed the rebellion? What lies beyond the forbidden zone?).
- **Relevant Characters & Interesting Locations:** Important NPCs and places that shape your story.

## How to Use Plot Nodes
- Add, edit, or remove nodes as your story evolves.
- Use them for inspiration, not limitation—leave them vague or detailed as you like.
- Random Prompts may invoke Plot Nodes for unexpected twists.
- Keep your list updated to reflect the current state of your story.
