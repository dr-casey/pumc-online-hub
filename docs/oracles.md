# Oracles

Oracles are a core feature of Plot Unfolding Machine, providing inspiration and answers to your questions as you play. This section summarizes the types of oracles, how to use them, and best practices from the official rulebook.

## What is an Oracle?
An Oracle is a randomizer that helps you answer questions, resolve uncertainty, or generate new ideas. Oracles can be as simple as a yes/no answer or as complex as a full scene prompt.

## Types of Oracles
- **Yes/No Oracles:** Answer binary questions (e.g., “Is the door locked?”)
- **Random Tables:** Provide a list of possible outcomes or inspirations.
- **Decks & Cards:** Draw a card for a random result or event.
- **Scene Prompts:** Suggest what happens next in the story.

## Using Oracles
1. Ask a clear question.
2. Roll or draw from the oracle.
3. Interpret the result in the context of your story.
4. Use the answer to inspire your next scene or decision.

## In-Game Oracles Panel

The Oracles Panel is your source of inspiration and random answers. Use it to resolve questions, spark ideas, or add surprises to your story.

### What You Can Do
- **Ask Questions:** Type or select a question and let the oracle provide a random answer.
- **Draw Prompts:** Get random story prompts, twists, or outcomes to keep the adventure moving.
- **Use Dice & Cards:** Roll dice or draw cards for unpredictable results.
- **Customize Decks:** Choose which oracles, decks, or tables to use based on your game's needs.

### In-Game Tips
- Use oracles when you're unsure what happens next or want to add drama.
- Combine multiple oracles for complex questions.
- The oracles panel is always available and doesn't interrupt your main play area.

## AI-Enhanced Oracles

If you have the [AI Assistant](ai-assistant.md) enabled, you can take your oracle usage to the next level:

- **Answer Directly:** Instead of just getting a "Yes/No" or a random word, you can ask a full question and have the AI provide a narrative answer. The AI rolls the underlying oracles for you and interprets them into a response that fits your current story context.
- **Build Narrative:** After rolling any oracle or random table, you can use the "Build Narrative" tool to have the AI help you interpret the result. It looks at your current plot, characters, and the oracle result to suggest exactly how that result manifests in your story.

- Use oracles to break creative blocks and add surprise.
