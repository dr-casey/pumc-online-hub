## Best Practices for Cloud Saves

- **Always connect the same Google account** on all your devices to keep your saves in sync.
- **Upload your game before switching devices** to ensure you have the latest version everywhere.
- **Check backup status regularly** in Application Settings to confirm your saves are up to date.
- **Use both cloud and local exports** for maximum safety—cloud for convenience, local for extra backup.
- **Keep your internet connection stable** during uploads and downloads to avoid incomplete saves.
- **If you play on multiple devices at once,** always upload your progress before switching, and download the latest save before playing.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- If you don’t see your latest game on another device, make sure you uploaded it from your main device and downloaded it on the new one.
- If you change your Google account, reconnect in Application Settings to restore access to your cloud saves.
- For large games or slow connections, uploads and downloads may take a little longer—wait for the status to confirm completion.
- If you ever have issues, exporting a local backup is a good safety net.
