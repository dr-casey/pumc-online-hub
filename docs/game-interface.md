# Game Interface

Welcome to the heart of the PUM Companion app: the in-game interface. This is where your adventure unfolds, your story grows, and all the tools you need are at your fingertips. Whether you’re playing on a desktop, tablet, or phone, the interface adapts to give you the best experience for your device.

## Interface Layouts

The interface automatically adjusts to your screen size, collapsing the panels as needed, and allowig you to slide vertical lines to resize them. You can also control the visibility of each panel and resize certain areas manually by dragging the thick dividers between them.

|---|---|---|---|
| Full Screen / Large (≥1920×1080) | Floating Window / Medium | Tablets | Smartphones |
| Panels shown side by side; all panels visible by default, unless disabled by setting. Entity tabs remain in text format. | Most frequently one of the panel behaves as floating rollout, while other remain visible on screen. | Typically log panel and entities overview will be visible, with both panels in rollout mode. | With one view at a time, showing the log panel by default, the tabs become icons. |

## Focus Mode Layout (Crystal Theme DLC feature)

Focus Mode is a special layout for the log panel that minimizes distractions for your storytelling, hiding unnecessary UI elements and emphasizing the log area.

While the prompt/proposal buttons are visible, focus mode (activated from the top toolbar) fades the rest of the UI so you can review the timeline with fewer distractions.

### Visual Model (Cinematic Overlay)

Making use of any plot beat button, oracle, random table, or drawing cards can trigger a cinematic overlay that displays a full-screen image to set the mood and progressively show their content, depending on the setting defined.

There are three settings for the cinematic overlay:

- **Disabled:** No cinematic overlay is shown.
