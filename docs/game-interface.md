# Game Interface

Welcome to the heart of the PUM Companion app: the in-game interface. This is where your adventure unfolds, your story grows, and all the tools you need are at your fingertips. Whether you’re playing on a desktop, tablet, or phone, the interface adapts to give you the best experience for your device.

## Interface Layouts

The interface automatically adjusts to your screen size, collapsing the panels as needed, and allowig you to slide vertical lines to resize them. You can also control the visibility of each panel and resize certain areas manually by dragging the thick dividers between them.

### User-Interface Settings

![settings-ui](assets/screenshots/settings-ui.png)

- Full screen: Hides borders (platform specific)
- Borderless mode: Hides window borders (desktop only)
- Use large fonts slider: Adjust the size of the text in the interface for better readability (limited to in-game text)
- Panels always collapsed: Keep the Oracle and Plot Nodes as rollout panels instead of expanding on large screens.
- Log area always as tab: Keeps the log area as a tab instead of a split view with entities on large screens.


### Monitors
Panels are shown side by side, giving you a broad view of your adventure. Starting at 1920x1080 resolution, all panels are visible at once. Typically using the app in window mode allows for multi-tasking, and fits usually the oracles panel to become visible and hides the plot nodes instead.

### Tablets
Panels may stack or slide out as needed, keeping things clear but compact.

### Smartphones
The interface simplifies, showing one main panel at a time. Menus and panels slide in and out so you’re never overwhelmed.
