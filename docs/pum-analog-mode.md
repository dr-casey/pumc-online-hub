# Analog Mode

Analog Mode is a special part of the app designed for quick inspiration, improvisation, and creative support. In this mode, nothing is saved—it's perfect for brainstorming, solo writing, or running tabletop sessions as a GM screen.

## Interface Overview

- **Top Bar:** At the top (on larger screens), you'll find the menu button and language selector, just like in the main app.
- **Oracles Panel:** The main area displays oracles—tools that answer your story questions, generate random events, or provide creative prompts. You can type a question and get instant results.
- **Random Tables:** Access tables for names, events, or other ideas. Roll on any table to get a result.
- **Dice Roller:** If enabled, a floating dice button appears. Tap it to open or hide the dice roller, where you can roll digital dice for any RPG system.
- **Decks Overview:** Draw cards for inspiration if you have decks enabled.
