# Log Panel

The Log Panel is your adventure's journal. Every event, twist, and outcome you record during play appears here, creating a living history of your story.

## What You Can Do
- **Add Entries:** Write new log entries to capture what happens in your game. Each entry can include text, formatting, and tags for easy reference.
- **Edit & Organize:** Edit previous entries, add details, or correct mistakes. Use formatting to highlight important moments.
- **Scroll & Search:** Quickly scroll through your adventure's history or use the search function to find specific events or keywords.
- **Tagging:** Use tags to mark entries by theme, character, or event type for fast filtering.

## Tips
- Use the log to track both story events and mechanical outcomes (like dice rolls or decisions).
- Regularly review your log to spot unresolved plot threads or recurring themes.
- The log is always saved automatically—no need to worry about losing your notes.
