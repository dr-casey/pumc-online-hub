## AI Feature Overview

PUM Companion uses specialized "AI Chains" to handle different tasks:

### ✍️ Writing Assistant
Found in most text editors within the app, the Writing Assistant can:

*   **Repair:** Spell-check and fix grammar issues in your writing.
*   **Enhance:** Improve the style and flow of your text.
*   **Elaborate:** Write and expand brief notes into detailed descriptions.
*   **Condense:** Summarize long passages into concise overviews.
*   **Instruct:** Follow specific commands to modify your text (e.g., "Make this more suspenseful").

### 👤 Entity Generation
When creating a new Character, Location, or Compendium, you can provide just a brief concept and let the AI fill in the details. It will generate a description, personality traits, and even a visual appearance that fits your world.

### 🎭 Plot Node Generation
Enhance your Plot Unfolding Machine with World Building and Obstacles for your story. The AI can suggest new plot nodes based on your game's genre and current narrative, helping to keep the story dynamic and engaging.

### 🎲 Build Narrative
Interpret the results of Oracles, Random Tables, and Dice Rolls within the context of your story. The AI helps you weave these random elements into a cohesive narrative beat, making sense of the "chaos" of the dice.

### 💬 Answer Directly
Ask the AI a direct question about your world or current situation. It uses the underlying Oracle systems to determine the outcome and then provides a narrative answer that fits your story's context.

### 🗣️ Discuss
A dedicated AI Chat feature for brainstorming. You can talk to the AI to bounce ideas, ask for suggestions on world-building, or get creative input on where your story could go next.

### 📝 Draft Game
Found in the New Game Wizard, this feature allows you to create a complete game proposal in seconds. The AI will fill in your plot scope, suggest key characters and locations, and even draft initial plot nodes to get your adventure started immediately.

### 🖼️ Image Generation
Either indirectly through creating Entities and Plot Nodes, or directly within a character or a location, you can generate images that match your specified style and description. The AI will create visuals that bring your world to life.
