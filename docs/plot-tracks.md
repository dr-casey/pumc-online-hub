# Plot Tracks

Plot Tracks are the backbone of your story’s structure in PUM. They help you organize your adventure into meaningful sections and keep your narrative moving forward.

## What is a Plot Track?
A Plot Track is a sequence of Plot Beats—important moments or scenes that advance your story. Think of it as a roadmap for your adventure, from beginning to end.

### Plot Scope
Before you create a Plot Track, define your Plot Scope. Is your story a full campaign, a short quest, or a single dramatic episode? The scope helps you decide how long and detailed your Plot Track should be.

### Types of Plot Tracks
PUM offers several Plot Track templates, each suited for different play styles:

- **Standard:** A generic structure for most games. Great for beginners and short stories.
- **Prepless:** Build your track as you go. Perfect for freeform or evolving stories.
- **Escalating:** For stories that ramp up in intensity and challenge.
- **Dungeon:** Structured for exploration and discovery.
- **Journey:** Focused on travel, quests, and progression.
- **Heroic:** Spotlight on protagonists and their personal arcs.
- **Survival:** Emphasizes danger, resource management, and overcoming adversity.
- **Crisis:** Episodic, problem-focused adventures.
- **Drama:** For introspective, character-driven stories.

### Customizing Your Track
You can edit, expand, or rename sections of your Plot Track at any time. For improvised games, add new beats as inspiration strikes!

## Advancing the Plot
You move forward on the Plot Track by playing Plot Beats. These can be:

- **Random Prompts:** Let PUM suggest what happens next.
- **Modified Proposals:** Propose an important moment, and let PUM add a modification.

Each Plot Beat can be a scene, event, or turning point. Use them to mark progress, celebrate victories, or introduce complications.

## In-Game Plot Track Panel

The Plot Track panel gives you a visual map of your story's structure and progress. It helps you see where you are in the adventure and what comes next.

### What You Can Do
- **View Structure:** See your story's main beats, scenes, or chapters laid out in order.
- **Add & Move Points:** Add new plot points, move them around, or edit their details as your story unfolds.
- **Customize:** Choose different plot track types (e.g., Standard, Dungeon, Journey) to match your adventure's style.
- **Focus:** Highlight the current scene or beat to keep everyone on track.

### In-Game Tips
- Use the plot track to plan ahead or improvise new twists.
- Update the track as your story changes—it's flexible and adapts to your needs.
- The plot track is always saved automatically.

*Add annotated screenshots to illustrate adding, moving, and focusing plot points.*

## Tips for Using Plot Tracks
- Don’t be afraid to skip, repeat, or change beats as your story evolves.
- Use the Plot Track as a guide, not a constraint.
- Mark your track as finished when your story concludes, or keep playing for epilogues and bonus scenes.
